# Phase 03 Plan 02: Content Polish + Launch Readiness

## Objective

Replace all placeholder lorem ipsum content with real, professional content across the portfolio. Update placeholder links and contact info to real values. Ensure the site is ready for public launch with polished copy and accurate data.

## Context

The portfolio site for Jacob Uphoff (QA Engineer) is functionally complete with responsive design, accessibility testing, and E2E test coverage. However, several pages contain lorem ipsum placeholder text and placeholder URLs that need to be replaced with real content before launch.

**Current placeholder state:**

- `src/app/about/page.tsx` — bio, philosophy, interests sections are all lorem ipsum
- `src/data/projects.ts` — all three projects have lorem ipsum descriptions
- `src/data/links.ts` — GitHub/LinkedIn/email all point to placeholder URLs
- `public/resume.pdf` — stub file needs real resume or placeholder handling

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update About Page with Real Content

**Type:** auto
**Done when:** About page bio, philosophy, and interests sections contain professional real content (no lorem ipsum)

Replace all lorem ipsum paragraphs in `src/app/about/page.tsx` with professional content appropriate for a Software QA Engineer portfolio:

- Bio section ("My Story"): Professional background as a QA engineer
- Philosophy section ("Approach to Quality"): Real QA philosophy emphasizing quality-first thinking, test automation strategy, shift-left testing
- Interests section ("Beyond Work"): Authentic personal interests

---

### Task 2: Update Projects Data with Real Content

**Type:** auto
**Done when:** All three projects in `src/data/projects.ts` have non-lorem-ipsum descriptions, titles, and case study content that reads as genuine QA engineering work

Replace the three placeholder projects with realistic QA engineering project descriptions. Each project should demonstrate different QA skills:

- Project 1: End-to-end test automation with Cypress/TypeScript
- Project 2: API testing with Playwright/Python
- Project 3: Legacy system test coverage with Selenium/Java

Each project needs: realistic title, short description, tags, and case study content (problem, approach, tools, results).

---

### Task 3: Update Links Data with Real Placeholder Values

**Type:** auto
**Done when:** `src/data/links.ts` GitHub and LinkedIn links are updated to use `uphoffjs` username (matching the Navbar), email uses a professional format, and the resume entry is clean

Update the placeholder links:

- GitHub: `https://github.com/uphoffjs` (matches Navbar)
- LinkedIn: `https://linkedin.com/in/uphoffjs` (reasonable default)
- Email: `mailto:jacob@uphoffjs.dev` (professional format)
- Resume href remains `/resume.pdf` (file will be managed separately)

---

### Task 4: Add Open Graph Meta Tags

**Type:** auto
**Done when:** `src/app/layout.tsx` has proper Open Graph metadata for social sharing (title, description, type)

Add Open Graph metadata to the root layout for better social sharing:

- `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`
- Keep it simple — no image needed for initial launch
- Enhances shareability when posting the portfolio URL

---

### Task 5: Verify Build Passes

**Type:** auto
**Done when:** `npm run build` completes without errors and the `out/` directory is populated

Run `npm run build` to ensure all content changes produce a clean static export. This validates:

- No TypeScript errors from content changes
- All pages export correctly
- Static generation works for all routes including `/projects/[slug]`

---

## Verification

- `npm run build` exits 0
- No lorem ipsum in any `.tsx` or `.ts` data files
- About page content reads as professional QA engineer bio
- Projects have real QA-themed content
- Links match uphoffjs GitHub username in Navbar

## Success Criteria

- [ ] About page: all four sections have real professional content
- [ ] Projects data: all three projects have QA-relevant non-placeholder content
- [ ] Links data: GitHub uses uphoffjs, no placeholder.com URLs
- [ ] Open Graph meta tags added to layout
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
